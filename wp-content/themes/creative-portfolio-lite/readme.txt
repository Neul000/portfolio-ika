== Description ==

A free WordPress theme called Creative Portfolio Lite is intended for use in the creation of individual portfolios as well as those of artists, designers, and independent contractors. Business portfolios, such as agency and architectural portfolios, can also benefit from it. This imaginative theme has a chic, understated style with a refined arrangement that flawlessly conveys your abilities and corporate goals via your website. Your portfolio will scale flawlessly across several devices whether it consists of images, video, or a combination of materials thanks to the theme's responsive design. Its simple layout draws attention to the most crucial details, and its retina-ready capability guarantees that all images and material are viewed with clarity. This theme does not require coding and has an intuitive interface, making it perfect for novices. It showcases a variety of information with sections like Team, Testimonials, and more, in addition to a fantastic banner. The entire appearance of your Creative Portfolio Lite website is improved by the animations and CSS effects. Conversion-boosting Call to Action (CTA) buttons on the theme, which is lightweight and streamlined, are built with clear, secure scripts. It provides quicker page loads and a wide range of customization choices because it is built on the Bootstrap framework. For a basic portfolio, video portfolio, or personal portfolio, this contemporary theme with social media icons is ideal. It is also translation-ready. The theme also offers choices for building a one-page portfolio or a fully functional website with a CV or resume section, and it supports Elementor for simple drag-and-drop creation.
